    content: "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ls2qvaB.jpg\" width=\"45%\"><br></br>\r\n\r\nI
      sensed the slow progressive change happening in Havana. I stayed at a Casa Particular
      (our version of a B&B owned by a lesbian couple) and much better than a hotel.
      I got the real deal experience. Private business though is a very new evolution
      that the government is slowly allowing. I was so happy to be immersed in Cuban
      life. The family who hosted me and the people I met explained how positive they
      feel about US/Cuba relations improving. Just to put things in perspective though
      they still have food rations and from what I was told the average salary in
      Cuba is $25-$50 a month. There is very little access to WiFi, credit cards,
      ATM machines all the stuff we take for granted. It actually felt great to be
      disconnected from all of \"that\" and can't wait to go back.\r\n\r\n"
