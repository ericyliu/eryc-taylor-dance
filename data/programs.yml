      from grant recipient Eryn Renee Young:<br></br>\r\n\r\n<i>Dear Eryc (and Andrew),<br></br>\r\n\r\nI
      just want to express my gratitude again for everything you did to make yesterday
      happen. I am so deeply appreciative of the opportunity you gave me, the connections
      I made, and the chance to push my career forward. More than that, I very much
      appreciate the invaluable belief in myself and my work that you showed. Your
      active commitment to propelling the work of young choreographers is so admirable
      I cannot begin to describe and I know that this opportunity has done and will
      do wonderful things for me and for others like myself. Thank you again.<br></br>\r\n\r\nHugs,<br></br>\r\nEryn
      Renee Young<br></br>"
